SourceMinder Roadmap for 2026

1. Additional Languages: Java (just this one next, others to follow, based on interest)

2. Add guides for php and typescript

3. Performance: Add multithreading to index files in parallel

4. Alternative Storage: Currently Sqlite only. Consider MySql/Postgres or other backends

5. Add --rows flag (or similar) to show only results, no help text, tips, or filtering info

6. Json-formatted output

NOT ON THE ROADMAP (... yet ...)

1. Call graph functionality (which functions call this function) -- better tools currently available
